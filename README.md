# IST719 Information Visualization

## Course Description
A broad introduction to data visualization for information professionals. Students will develop a portfolio of resources, demonstrations, recipes, and examples of various data visualization techniques.

Introduction to skills and techniques related to information visualization, through the R programming language and Adobe Illustrator. These skills include using data cleaning techniques, controlling the R graphics environment, developing custom plots, visually exploring data, using design concepts to visually communicate the story in the data, and discussing issues related to the ethics of data visualization. Conceptual themes will be presented alongside technical aspects of data visualization. Additional work and higher grading expected of graduate students.

## Learning Objectives
After taking this course, the students will be able to:

- Use R to do basic data cleaning and preparation on a wide range of datasets
  - Use functions to summarize and compare fields
  - Find missing values
  - Use subsets or filter data
  - Retype data into correct format
- Identify stories in datasets through exploration
  - Use R to create appropriate rough plots to identify distributions and relationships in the data
  - Use data subsetting and filtering to home in on questions of interest
- Create rich visual artifacts that communicate data stories
  - Identify the optimal type of visualization to minimize viewer cognitive overload and maximize image interpretability
  - Enhance viewer cognition through context cues
  - Use basic design principles to enhance viewer receptivity and convey meaning
  - Use Adobe Illustrator to combine R data visualizations, design elements, and context cues into a single artifact
